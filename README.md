# Rock-Paper-Scissor-with-Teachable-Machine
A small game with Teachable Machine


# Hello everyone !

This is a rock-paper-scissor game based on AI(artificial intelligence) .

We make this possible by using Teaching Mchine.

First we give enough samples to the Teaching Machine for training.

we can control the training on Teachable machine with advanced parameters like batch size, number of epochs, learning rate.

It gives an accurate model based on the samples given by us. Later, we get a javascript code.

# In this project

This project gets image input from the player.

And based on the training model script code from Teachable machine it classifies the input into rock or paper or scissor and the computer's input
is genrated randomly.


Based on the rules of the game 10 points are allocated for each win.
