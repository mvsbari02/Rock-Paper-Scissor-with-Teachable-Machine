With Teachable Machine


# Hello everyone !

This is a rock-paper-scissor game based on AI(artificial intelligence).

This is done with the help of #Techable Machine.

On teachable machine we can train with different image samples or audio samples or body postures.

we can control the training on Teachable machine with advanced parameters like batch size, number of epochs, learning rate.

It builds a very good model based on sample data given by us. We can get the training model js script code from it.

# In this project

This project gets image input from user.

And based on the training model script code from Teachable machine it classifies the input into rock or paper or scissor and the computer's input
is genrated randomly.

Based on the rules of the game 10 points are allocated for each win. 

# Teachable machine is a very useful platform to create many such projects.
